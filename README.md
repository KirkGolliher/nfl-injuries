## Motivation

I have chosen this topic because injuries are so impactful in sports. I’ve always been curious with what happens to players once they obtain a significant injury and how much it impacts their statistics once they recover. I personally have never experienced an injury like this, but I have seen many players have their careers cut short due to major injuries. It’d be interesting to see the factors that play a role in this happening.

## Data Questions

1) Which significant injury occurred most often in a span of four NFL seasons?
2) Which offense position group has the highest rate of injuries? 
3) Within each position group, which injury is more common? 
4) Is field type a major factor in certain injuries? (grass vs. turf) 


## Data Sources

- [Pro Sports Transactions](https://www.prosportstransactions.com/football/Search/Search.php) was used for gathering the players and their specific injuries.
- [Advanced Sports Analytics](https://www.advancedsportsanalytics.com/nfl-raw-data) was used to obtain player's game stats for the past three seasons (2019-2022).

## The Process

#### Data Acquisition

I found two sources of data for this project. My first source (Pro Sports Transactions) provided me with the injury reports for players. This showed me the date of the report, player name, team, and the injury. This is what I used to find the players, and it allowed me to search the specific injury. After searching for the specific injury, I scraped the website to obtain the data. I had to do this three total times and each time had 10+ pages to be scraped. 

The second source (Advanced Sports Analytics) was a CSV file that contained raw NFL data. This source provided me with information for each player's statistics in each game. The data started at the beginning of the 2019 season. The challenge with this source was to clean it and figure out exactly what to use from it since I could only use two season's worth of data.
