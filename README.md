# The Impact of NFL Injuries on Players

## Table of Contents

## Motivation

I have chosen this topic because injuries are so impactful in sports. I’ve always been curious with what happens to players once they obtain a significant injury and how much it impacts their statistics once they recover. I personally have never experienced an injury like this, but I have seen many players have their careers cut short due to major injuries. It’d be interesting to see the factors that play a role in this happening.

## Data Questions

- Are players as productive once they recover from a significant injury such as torn acl, foot/ankle, concussions, etc? 
- Do certain factors such as, recovery time or a particular injury correlate to possible reinjury?
- Is field type a major factor in certain injuries? (grass vs. turf)
- What are the most common injuries through the years in the NFL?
